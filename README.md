# Active Directory Setup with Windows 10 Client

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the installation and configuration of a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller and the integration of a Windows 10 client into an Active Directory environment.
The setup was carried out in a virtualized lab using Oracle VirtualBox, simulating a real-world enterprise network.
Key tasks included deploying Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), configuring DNS, creating domain users, and joining a client machine to the domain for centralized authentication and management.

## Objectives

- Install and configure Windows Server 2019 as a Domain Controller.
- Set up Active Directory Domain Services and create a new forest/domain.
- Configure DNS to support domain operations.
- Join a Windows 10 client to the newly created domain.
- Apply real-world troubleshooting techniques for installation and network issues.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Oracle VirtualBox
- Windows Server 2019 (Datacenter Evaluation â€“ Desktop Experience)
- Windows 10 (Client)
- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS Server
- Command-line Networking Tools (ipconfig, ping, nslookup, etc.)
